    - *"Show me a temperature map of the Arabian Sea for last month."*
    - *"Where were the highest salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic last week?"*
    - *"Compare the satellite-observed surface temperature with the nearest ARGO float's measurement."*

    By combining the high accuracy of ARGO floats (at depth) with the broad coverage of satellites (at the surface), we create a richer, more complete dataset.

        This is the core scientific step. We need to align the ARGO data with the satellite grid.

        - **Alignment:** For a given ARGO profile, find the corresponding satellite data pixel for the same day.
        - **Fusion Technique:** Use a method like **Optimal Interpolation (OI)**. Think of it as using the highly accurate ARGO data points to "correct" or "nudge" the broader satellite map, creating a more accurate final product.
